#Problem:
1.  My girlfriend's parents are quiet, and if I talk too much I'll drown them out
2.  I want to learn the basics of react, and maybe build some basic animations using React Motion


#Hypothesis:
1. By building a single page web-app that
    +  Lets me keep track of the participants in a conversation
    +  Can show a visible ratio of how long each person has spent speaking.
    +  Only persists data to local storage
    +  Looks alright on mobile

2. I will be able to 
    +  Make sure I'm not the most talkative
    +  Take extra steps to pull the least talkative person out of their shell
    +  Build an intuition for building apps in React. 


#Solution:

+   npm install
+   reapp run
+   or visit parleyou.com 
+   deployed via surge.sh, uses webpack, and reapp components (which are no longer maintained)
